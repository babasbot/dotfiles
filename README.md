# dotfiles

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files. They are called "dotfiles" as they
are typically named with a leading dot, making them hidden.

This repository mainly contains my shell and editor configurations and
preferences.

Why would I want to version my dotfiles on GitHub?

- Backup, restore, and sync my preference and settings.
- Share what I've learned.
- Learn from others
